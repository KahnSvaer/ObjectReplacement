# ObjectReplacement
This project detects and replaces objects in images using AI. It first identifies objects with a zero-shot model, generates segmentation masks, and then replaces the detected object with new content through inpainting using Stable Diffusion XL. The system allows for automatic image editing driven by text prompts.
